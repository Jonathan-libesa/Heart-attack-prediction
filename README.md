The "Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset" is a dataset used for heart attack classification":

Background:
The dataset is designed for the classification of heart attacks, a critical medical condition.
It is used for analytical and machine learning tasks related to predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on various medical attributes.

Dataset Size:

The dataset contains 304 rows (samples) and 14 columns (features).

Features:

The dataset includes several features (attributes) that provide information about patients and their health conditions. These features can be used to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. Some of the key features include:
age: The age of the patient.
sex: The gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male).
cp: Chest pain type (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic).
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
chol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl).
fbs: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl) (1 = true, 0 = false).
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
thal: Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder) results (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect).
Target Variable:
The target variable in this dataset is often output or target, which indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a heart attack
